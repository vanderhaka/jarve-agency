## Example 1: MVP Development + Sydney

**Service:** MVP Development  
**City:** Sydney, NSW  
**Price:** $5-12K  
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

```json
{
  "heroHeadline": "Test Your Idea Before You Bet Everything",
  "heroSubheadline": "Working MVP in 2-4 weeks for $5-12K. Prove it works before you burn through runway.",
  "cityContext": "Sydney pulls 40% of Australia's tech funding. Accelerators like Startmate and Stone & Chalk expect working software, not pitch decks. A functional MVP gets you into rooms that slides can't.",
  "problemStatement": "You've got an idea and need to prove it works. Agencies quote $50K and three months. You could build it yourself, but you've got a business to run. Meanwhile, runway's burning and competitors are shipping.",
  "solution": "I build MVPs that prove your concept — not bloated apps with features nobody asked for. Core functionality, user auth, deployed and live. Two to four weeks. You get something real to show investors and test with actual users.",
  "benefits": [
    {
      "title": "Validate Before You Scale",
      "description": "Find out if customers actually want this before spending six months building the wrong thing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Investor-Ready Product",
      "description": "Show up to funding conversations with something that works, not promises and mockups."
    },
    {
      "title": "Post-Launch Support",
      "description": "One week of support after launch to fix what breaks and learn from early users."
    }
  ],
  "localSignals": [
    "Australian timezone — no 3am messages from offshore teams or waiting a day for replies.",
    "ABN registered, GST invoices, payment in AUD. No currency conversion or international transfers.",
    "Most Sydney clients never need a face-to-face, but happy to video call whenever."
  ],
  "ctaText": "Discuss Your MVP",
  "metaDescription": "MVP development for Sydney startups. $5-12K, 2-4 weeks. Solo Australian developer who builds working products, not pitch decks.",
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What's included in the $5-12K price range?",
      "answer": "Core features, user authentication, responsive design, deployment, and one week post-launch support. Price depends on complexity — I'll give you a fixed quote upfront."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work with my accelerator's timeline?",
      "answer": "Yes. Most accelerators want progress in weeks, not months. My 2-4 week timeline fits batch schedules at Startmate, Antler, and similar programs. I've hit tight demo day deadlines before."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you work remotely with Sydney clients?",
      "answer": "Daily check-ins via video call, shared project board so you see progress, and I'm available during business hours. Distance doesn't slow things down."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if the MVP needs changes after launch?",
      "answer": "First week of tweaks is included. After that, I can build new features based on user feedback or hand over the code if you're hiring developers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is this different from hiring a full development team?",
      "answer": "You get one experienced developer focused on your project, not junior devs managed by account people. Faster decisions, clearer communication, better results."
    }
  ],
  "layout": "standard",
  "testimonialMatch": "Sydney startup founder who validated their idea with an MVP before raising seed funding."
}
```

### Why This Works

- **City context is specific:** 40% funding stat, Startmate/Stone & Chalk with real insight about what they expect
- **Voice is authentic:** "burn through runway", "slides can't" — sounds like someone who knows startups
- **FAQ is market-specific:** Accelerator timeline question is genuinely Sydney-relevant
- **Local signals are practical:** Timezone, ABN/GST, video call availability

## Example 2: Internal Tools + Perth

**Service:** Internal Tools  
**City:** Perth, WA  
**Price:** $8-20K  
**Timeline:** 3-6 weeks

```json
{
  "heroHeadline": "Replace the Spreadsheets Your Team Hates",
  "heroSubheadline": "Custom internal tools built in 3-6 weeks. $8-20K. Designed around how your team actually works.",
  "cityContext": "Perth businesses run on spreadsheets built during the last boom. They sort of work, but nobody wants to touch them. Meanwhile, your Sydney-based developer answers emails at 2pm your time. I work AWST hours and I've built tools for resources and construction workflows.",
  "problemStatement": "Your ops run on a spreadsheet someone built in 2014. It's held together with VLOOKUP and hope. Staff tracking across three sites lives in someone's head. Compliance docs are scattered across shared drives. Everyone's got workarounds. Nobody trusts the data.",
  "solution": "I build the tools your team actually needs — job tracking, site scheduling, compliance dashboards. Not a generic platform you'll fight against. Something built around your process, that connects to what you already use, and that people will actually open every morning.",
  "benefits": [
    {
      "title": "Built for Your Process",
      "description": "Not an off-the-shelf tool you force your workflow into — software shaped around how your operations actually run."
    },
    {
      "title": "Works Across Sites",
      "description": "Whether your crew's in the office, on-site in the Pilbara, or somewhere in between — one system everyone can access."
    },
    {
      "title": "Training Included",
      "description": "Full documentation and team training so it actually gets used, not abandoned after a week."
    }
  ],
  "localSignals": [
    "I work AWST hours. Message me at 9am Perth time, get a response the same morning.",
    "ABN registered, GST invoices, AUD pricing. No offshore rates that triple once you factor in back-and-forth.",
    "Built tools for mining services and construction before. I understand site-based operations and compliance requirements."
  ],
  "ctaText": "Talk Through Your Requirements",
  "metaDescription": "Internal tools for Perth businesses. $8-20K, 3-6 weeks. Replace spreadsheet workarounds with software built for resources and construction workflows.",
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can site crews access this on tablets or phones?",
      "answer": "Yes. Everything I build is responsive and works on mobile. For remote sites with patchy internet, I can build offline-capable tools that sync when connection's available."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle the timezone difference from Adelaide?",
      "answer": "I work AWST hours when needed. Message me at 9am Perth time, get a response the same morning. Most communication happens async via Slack or email anyway."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in the $8-20K price range?",
      "answer": "Custom tool built to your process, integrations with your existing systems, team training, full documentation, and two weeks post-launch support for fixes and tweaks."
    }
  ],
  "layout": "problem-first",
  "testimonialMatch": "Perth operations manager in mining services or construction who replaced spreadsheet workarounds with a custom internal tool."
}
```

### Why This Works

- **City context addresses real pain:** Timezone difference from Sydney, "last boom" timing reference
- **Problem is visceral:** "VLOOKUP and hope", "lives in someone's head" — recognisable pain
- **Benefit has local specificity:** Pilbara reference is genuinely Perth/WA
- **FAQ is industry-relevant:** Offline capability for remote sites is a real mining/resources need
- **Local signals hit the timezone pain:** AWST hours explicitly mentioned

## Example 3: Web App Development + Brisbane

**Service:** Web App Development  
**City:** Brisbane, QLD  
**Price:** $12-25K  
**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks

```json
{
  "heroHeadline": "Software That Scales With Your Growth",
  "heroSubheadline": "Custom web apps in 4-8 weeks for $12-25K. Replace the systems you've outgrown.",
  "cityContext": "Brisbane's growing faster than the systems running its businesses. That client portal hacked together in 2019 worked fine at 15 jobs a month. Now you're doing 50 and it's falling apart. With the Olympics pipeline ramping up, this problem only gets worse.",
  "problemStatement": "You've outgrown spreadsheets and generic tools. Client updates go out late because someone forgot to check the shared doc. Quoting takes hours of copy-paste. Your team's built workarounds on top of workarounds. The systems that got you here won't get you to the next level.",
  "solution": "I build web apps that fit how your business actually runs — client portals, quote systems, operations dashboards. Integrates with Xero, Google, whatever you're already using. Something your team will open every day because it makes their job easier, not harder.",
  "benefits": [
    {
      "title": "Clients Get Self-Service",
      "description": "A portal where clients check progress, approve quotes, and download documents — without calling your office."
    },
    {
      "title": "Integrates With Your Stack",
      "description": "Connects to Xero, Google Workspace, your project management tools. No more double-entry or data living in silos."
    },
    {
      "title": "Two Weeks Post-Launch Support",
      "description": "I stick around after launch to fix what breaks and adjust based on how your team actually uses it."
    }
  ],
  "localSignals": [
    "AEST timezone — same working hours as you. Questions answered the same day, not 24 hours later.",
    "ABN registered, GST invoices, AUD pricing. Straightforward.",
    "Happy to meet in person in Brisbane if that's useful, but most clients prefer video calls and getting on with it."
  ],
  "ctaText": "Discuss Your Project",
  "metaDescription": "Web app development for Brisbane businesses. $12-25K, 4-8 weeks. Client portals, dashboards, and custom tools that replace what you've outgrown.",
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "We're growing fast — can the app handle more users later?",
      "answer": "Yes. I build on infrastructure that scales. If you're at 20 users now and need 200 in two years, the app handles it without a rebuild."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens after the app launches?",
      "answer": "Two weeks of post-launch support included. After that, I offer ongoing development at hourly rates or hand over the codebase with full documentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate with Xero and our existing tools?",
      "answer": "Yes. Most Brisbane businesses I work with use Xero, Google Workspace, and some kind of project management tool. I build integrations so data flows between systems automatically."
    }
  ],
  "layout": "benefits-grid",
  "testimonialMatch": "Brisbane business owner in construction or professional services who replaced outdated systems to handle rapid growth."
}
```

### Why This Works

- **City context is growth-focused:** Olympics 2032 reference, "15 jobs to 50" scaling narrative
- **Problem matches the market:** Outgrowing systems, not legacy/mining like Perth
- **FAQ addresses growth:** "Can the app handle more users later?" — Brisbane's core concern
- **Local signals match culture:** Offers in-person meeting (relationship-oriented market), "get on with it" attitude

## Example 4: Industry Page — Construction

**Route:** `/industries/construction`
**Type:** Industry page (no city)

```json
{
  "heroHeadline": "Software for Builders Who Build",
  "heroSubheadline": "Job tracking, quoting, and compliance tools for construction businesses. $8-25K.",
  "cityContext": "Construction across Australia runs on paper job sheets, WhatsApp groups, and someone's memory. Margins are thin enough without losing hours to admin that software should handle.",
  "problemStatement": "Your site manager tracks 30 jobs on a whiteboard. Quotes live in Word docs nobody can find. Compliance paperwork gets done at 10pm because the day was spent actually building. Subcontractor invoices sit in an email folder labelled 'TO DO'.",
  "solution": "I build tools that match how construction actually works — mobile-first job tracking, quoting systems that pull from your rate cards, compliance dashboards that flag what's overdue. Built by someone who ran a trades business for 20 years.",
  "benefits": [
    {
      "title": "Mobile-First Job Tracking",
      "description": "Your crew updates job status from site. No more calling the office to find out what's happening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Quoting in Minutes",
      "description": "Pull from saved rate cards, add variations, send a professional quote — without opening a spreadsheet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compliance That Flags Itself",
      "description": "Expiring licences, overdue safety docs, missing sign-offs — the system tells you before it's a problem."
    }
  ],
  "localSignals": [
    "Australian-based developer, ABN registered, invoices in AUD with GST.",
    "I ran a painting business for 20 years — I understand trades workflows, not just code.",
    "ACST timezone, available during business hours."
  ],
  "ctaText": "Talk About Your Workflow",
  "metaDescription": "Construction software by an ex-tradesman turned developer. Job tracking, quoting, compliance tools. $8-25K, built for how construction actually works.",
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Do you understand construction workflows or just software?",
      "answer": "Both. I ran a painting business for 20 years before switching to software. I know what it's like to juggle jobs, subs, and paperwork. That experience shapes everything I build."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can site crews use this on their phones?",
      "answer": "Yes. Everything is mobile-first and works on any device. For remote sites with poor reception, I can build offline capability that syncs when connection returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the typical price range?",
      "answer": "Between $8K and $25K depending on complexity. A simple job tracker is at the lower end. A full quoting, scheduling, and compliance system is at the higher end. Fixed quote upfront."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take?",
      "answer": "Three to eight weeks depending on scope. I start with the most painful problem first so you see value quickly, then build out from there."
    }
  ],
  "layout": "problem-first",
  "testimonialMatch": "Construction business owner who replaced paper-based job tracking and quoting with a custom tool."
}
```

### Why This Works

- **Industry page, no city** — speaks to the entire Australian construction sector
- **James's background shines:** 20 years in painting gives genuine credibility with tradies
- **Problem is visceral:** Whiteboard, WhatsApp groups, 10pm compliance — recognisable pain
- **4 FAQs** — demonstrates mid-range of the 3-5 FAQ guideline
- **Voice is authentic:** "Builders who build", "someone's memory" — not marketing speak

## Variation Analysis

| Element | Sydney (service+city) | Perth (service+city) | Brisbane (service+city) | Construction (industry) |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Core narrative** | Startup validation | Legacy system replacement | Scaling with growth | Trades workflow automation |
| **Key reference** | Startmate, 40% funding | AWST timezone, Pilbara | Olympics pipeline, 15→50 jobs | 20 years painting business |

## Using These Examples

When generating new content:

1. **Compare against these examples** — Is your output at this quality level?
2. **Do the swap test** — Could the content work for a different city?
3. **Check the voice** — Does it sound like James or like a brochure?
4. **Verify word counts** — pSEO pages need to be scannable, not essays

If the output doesn't match this quality, regenerate with more specific city details in the prompt.
